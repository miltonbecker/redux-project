# Features:

* You can create and delete comments

* Adding a comment follows an optimistic approach, that is:
  * The comment gets added instantaneously 
  * Its id is temporary while the API is processing  
  * Once the API is done and responds, the comment gets its real id (the id generated by the database)  
  * The user will only be able to delete it once it gets its real id
  * If there is an error on the server side, the user is notified and that comment gets removed

* Deleting a comment also follows an optimistic approach:
  * The comment gets deleted instantaneously
  * If there is an error on the server side, the user is notified and the comments are re-fetched from the server

* npm scripts:
  * `npm start` starts the server in production mode without the webpack hooks
  * `npm run dev` starts the server with the webpack hooks
  * `npm run build` generates the production bundle
  * `npm run docker` generates the production bundle and creates the docker image
